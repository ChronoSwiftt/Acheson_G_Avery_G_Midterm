# Battlefield Vs. Call of Duty

## Battlefield is better
### Greg's Argument
![Battlefield V in game photo](class="jpg"></bfv_ray_tracing> "BFV Ray Tracing")
In my opinion, I think that the battlefield franchise is much better than the Call of Duty franchise in many ways. My main point on this is that Battlefield offers better realistic gameplay compared to Call of Duty. The ways that make it more realistic are that the multiplayer maps are three times the size of COD maps which give the player a larger area to explore.

### Other Reasons: 
<ul>
	<li>realistic graphics</li>
	<li>larger teams</li>
	<li>detailed maps</li>
	<li>playable vehicles</li>
	<li>fully destructable buildings</li>
</ul>

## Call of Duty is Better
### Gerrit's Argument
![Cod WW2 in game](class="jpg"></cod_ww2>)
In my opinion the Call of Duty franchise is much better than the Battlefield franchise because of the immense popularity of the game in esports and sales. Call of Duty offers more game modes and adds a third mode called Zombies. The esports side of the game offers a tournament scene that sees millions of dollars in prize money.

### Other Reasons:
<ul>
	<li>More Intense Gamemodes</li>
	<li>Nostalgic Maps</li>
	<li>Competitive Amateur Esports Scene</li>
	<li>Realistic Guns</li>
	<li> Constant Patches Adding New Content</li>
</ul>
