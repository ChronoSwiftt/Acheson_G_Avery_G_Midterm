# Battlefield Vs. Call of Duty


## Battlefield is better
### Greg's Argument

In my opinion, I think that the battlefield franchise is much better than the Call of Duty franchise in many ways. My main point on this is that Battlefield offers better realistic gameplay compared to Call of Duty. The ways that make it more realistic are that the multiplayer maps are three times the size of COD maps which give the player a larger area to explore.
